WikiRacer Algorithm Tester
Overview
This project consists of two main components:

A Tkinter-based GUI application to compare two algorithms for finding the shortest path between two Wikipedia pages.
Implementation of the algorithms for finding the shortest path: Bidirectional BFS and a custom Heuristic-based DFS.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter
mediawiki Python package
Install the required package using:
pip install mediawiki
Usage
GUI Application
The GUI application allows users to input the start and end Wikipedia pages and run two different algorithms to find the shortest path between them. It displays the runtime for each algorithm and the path found.
